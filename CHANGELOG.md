## [2026.6.1] - 2026-06-18

### Added

* **Unique Branding & Name:** Renamed the app from the generic "Workout Logger" to **FlinkLog** (
  inspired by the German word *flink*, meaning quick, nimble, or agile).
* **Play Store Listing Assets:** Configured the 30-character App Title (
  `FlinkLog: Tiny Workout (<3MB)`) and the 80-character Short Description (
  `Tiny <3MB workout log. Simple, fast, offline, no cloud, no ads, no tracking.`).
* **Android 16 AppFunctions Integration:** Exposed 4 key app capabilities (`logWorkout`,
  `getWorkoutsForRange`, `getCustomWorkoutTypes`, and `suggestWorkout`) locally on-device for
  assistant integrations (like Google Gemini).
* **Google Auto Backup:** Configured robust system backup policies (including SQLite database
  journals, WAL, and SHM files) for seamless, encrypted data transfer when switching devices.
* **Custom Workout Categories:** Added capability to create new permanent exercises dynamically via
  the `+` chip and delete them via the `x` chip on category lists.
* **Multi-Activity Logging:** Enabled selecting multiple exercises at once, entering custom notes
  per activity in a bottom sheet, and copying notes to all selection rows instantly using "Copy to
  All".
* **History Screen:** Introduced monthly calendar view toggles with dot indicators for active days
  and a collapsible 7-day rolling weekly view.
* **Inline Editing & Swipe-to-Delete:** Added capability to edit notes post-logging and delete
  entries with a swipe-to-left gesture, accompanied by an instantaneous "Undo" action.
* **Swipe Tutorial Onboarding:** Added a dismissible guidance card for first-time users explaining
  how to swipe to delete.
* **Material You Theme support:** Fully dynamic light and dark theme adaptation matching system
  colors.
* **Programmatic Brand Visuals:** Replaced heavy raster assets with clean, lightweight Canvas-drawn
  graphics:
    * `EmptyHomeIllustration` (Kettlebell)
    * `EmptyHistoryIllustration` (Calendar moon & stars)
    * `FlinkLogBrandLogo` (Refined non-overlapping dumbbell and log checklist on the About page)

### Changed

* **Privacy & Support Email Obfuscation:** Replaced the developer email in documentation and strings
  with an obfuscated layout (`h.arunbuilds+workoutlogger [at] gmail [dot] com`) to prevent spam
  scraping.
* **Unified UI Design:** Unified all three action cards on the About screen (Share, Rate, and
  Feedback) to use the primary container color theme for visual cohesion.
* **Adaptive App Icon Wrapper:** Switched the launcher logo rendering on the About screen from
  Compose's `Image` to an `AndroidView`/`ImageView` wrapper to natively support adaptive icon
  layouts.

### Fixed

* **Compose LocalContext Lint Errors:** Fixed all 10 `LocalContextGetResourceValueCall` and
  `LocalContextResourcesRead` errors by switching to Compose's configuration-aware
  `LocalResources.current` API for async and callback-based resource fetches.
* **String Resource Percent Parsing Crash:** Fixed a formatting warning/potential crash by escaping
  raw `%` characters to `%%` in `strings.xml`.
* **Clean Git History:** Rewrote local and remote Git commit history to clean up raw personal emails
  in previous commits, updating the author email mapping to the GitHub no-reply address.
