# FlinkLog — Agent Guidelines & Memory File

This workspace contains project-specific rules, design patterns, and lessons learned during the development of FlinkLog. Future AI agents must read and strictly adhere to these instructions to prevent regressions.

## 💡 Lessons Learned & Critical Rules

### 1. Adaptive Icon Handling in Compose
*   **Problem:** Google Play's adaptive icons (`R.mipmap.ic_launcher`) use `<adaptive-icon>` XML structures containing foreground and background layers. Loading this directly in Compose using `painterResource()` will trigger a fatal `IllegalArgumentException` at runtime.
*   **Rule:** Always wrap adaptive icons in a standard platform `AndroidView` with an `ImageView`:
    ```kotlin
    AndroidView(
        factory = { ctx ->
            ImageView(ctx).apply {
                setImageResource(R.mipmap.ic_launcher)
            }
        },
        modifier = Modifier.size(80.dp)
    )
    ```

### 2. String Resource Formatting & Percent Escaping
*   **Problem:** Android's `strings.xml` parser treats raw `%` symbols followed by letters (e.g., `100% open-source`) as format specifiers (interpreting `% o` as octal `%o`). This causes compilation failures, PluralsCandidate lint warnings, or runtime formatter crashes.
*   **Rule:** Always escape `%` characters in `strings.xml` as `%%` (e.g., `100%% open-source`).

### 3. Configuration-Aware Resource Fetching
*   **Problem:** Reading resources via `LocalContext.current.getString()` inside Composables or async contexts (like `LaunchedEffect` collectors or dialog buttons) triggers `LocalContextGetResourceValueCall` lint errors. These calls are not reactive to configuration changes (like language or orientation changes), resulting in stale UI text.
*   **Rule:** 
    *   For standard UI text, use `stringResource(...)`.
    *   For resource lookups inside callback lambdas, coroutines, or event collectors, query `LocalResources.current` instead:
        ```kotlin
        val resources = LocalResources.current
        LaunchedEffect(Unit) {
            viewModel.events.collect { event ->
                // Safe, configuration-aware string retrieval:
                val msg = resources.getString(R.string.workout_deleted_msg)
            }
        }
        ```

### 4. Code Minification & Reflection Safeguards (Android 16 AppFunctions)
*   **Problem:** AppFunctions rely heavily on compilation reflection. Code shrinkers (like R8) will strip out or rename metadata classes in release builds, causing runtime AppFunction execution failure.
*   **Rule:** Keep proguard rules in `app/proguard-rules.pro` to safeguard AppFunction compilation pipelines.

### 5. Release Preparation & App Store / GitHub Release Notes
*   **Rule:** Whenever preparing a release build or pushing a release tag, the agent must automatically generate a professional Release Title and Release Notes tailored for GitHub based on the changelog updates, and prompt the user to copy/paste them.
*   **Rule (Play Store Listing & Notes):** Future changes should **not** include anything technical in the Play Store listing or "What's new" release notes. Avoid technical jargon (e.g., ADB commands). Keep all public-facing text sleek, simple, and strictly user-focused.

### 6. Notes Auto-Suggestions in Bottom Sheet
*   **Problem:** Displaying suggestions inline can clutter the screen or shift the keyboard layout, causing layout overlap or input focus issues.
*   **Rule:** Suggestions must be loaded dynamically based on the current active workout type using `getRecentNotesForWorkoutType` and deduplicated against the user's active input. Suggestions must be hidden inside a trailing drop-down menu (`DropdownMenu`) on the text field, accessible only when suggestions are available and the user clicks the drop-down arrow icon.

## ⚖️ Compliance & Rating Rules
*   **IARC Re-rating:** Any change that introduces new content profiles (e.g., violence, UGC, social features, in-app purchases) requires re-doing the IARC questionnaire. When making such changes, you **must** flag a warning in your PR description or commit message. See `docs/COMPLIANCE.md` for the full list of triggers and the exact warning template to use.

---

## 🔒 Security & Privacy Rules
*   **Personal Info Scrubbing:** Never write raw personal email addresses in code, strings, or Markdown files. If a contact email must be shown in documentation (e.g. `PRIVACY_POLICY.md`), use an obfuscated layout like: `h.arunbuilds+workoutlogger [at] gmail [dot] com`.
*   **Git Author Email:** All commits must use the GitHub no-reply address: `ArunYogeshwaran@users.noreply.github.com`.

---

## 🏗️ Core Architecture & Flow Rules
*   **Architecture:** Follow MVVM with clean database access:
    *   Presentation: Jetpack Compose (using custom Canvas graphics for light weight).
    *   Database: SQLite via Android Room (configured for Google Auto Backup with WAL/SHM file handling).
    *   AppFunctions: Keep `WorkoutAppFunctions` in sync with any changes made to `WorkoutRepository`.
*   **Compilation & Linting:** Always run `./gradlew compileDebugKotlin lintDebug` to verify changes before making any commit.

---

## 📝 Git Commit Guidelines
*   **Commit Message Format:** All commits must follow the **Conventional Commits** specification (the standard format used in European Union/European Commission open source repositories).
*   **Structure:** `<type>(<scope>): <subject>`
    *   `type`: `feat`, `fix`, `docs`, `style`, `refactor`, `perf`, `test`, `chore`, `build`, `ci`.
    *   `scope` (optional): The package or module affected (e.g. `(ui)`, `(db)`, `(appfunctions)`).
    *   `subject`: A concise, imperative mood summary (e.g., `feat: add templates`, not `Added templates`).
*   **Length Constraints:** Keep commit messages short and concise. The subject line must be under 50 characters, and no line of the commit message should exceed 72 characters.

---

## 🛑 Rule & Memory Maintenance
*   **Mandatory Update:** Whenever you introduce a new feature, database schema change, AppFunction API, library dependency, or resolve a complex compilation/lint issue, you **must** update:
    *   The corresponding feature file under docs/features/ and/or docs/README/ with updated specifications and verification test cases.
    *   DEVELOPMENT.md with developer instructions.
    *   .agents/AGENTS.md with agent guidelines.
    This must be done before completing the task to ensure product specifications remain the single source of truth.
