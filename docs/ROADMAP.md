# 🗺️ FlinkLog — Future Features & Engineering Roadmap

This document outlines planned features, user-experience enhancements, and technical milestones for **FlinkLog**. Any future developer or AI agent should consult this roadmap before starting major feature development to ensure alignment with our design principles.

---

## 🎯 Core Engineering Constraints
Any new feature implementation **MUST** respect the following guidelines:
1.  **Lightweight Footprint (<3.5MB):** Do not add external libraries that bloat the APK size (e.g., avoid large chart or network libraries). Prefer custom, lightweight Compose `Canvas` implementations.
2.  **Privacy-First & Offline-First:** No remote databases, user accounts, analytics tracking, or cloud APIs. All data must reside strictly in the local SQLite database.
3.  **Encrypted Sync via OS:** Rely strictly on **Google Auto Backup** for cloud transfers/backups.

## 📋 1. Roadmap Tracks & Tasks

### 🔥 IMMEDIATE PRIORITY (BLOCKERS FOR NEXT RELEASE)
*   **[x] E1: Update Play Store Size Wording**
    *   *Description:* Adjusted the Play Store listing size references to under 3.5MB (based on the verified download size of ~3.3MB on actual devices) and strongly highlighted the Auto Backup restore behavior.
*   **[ ] E2: Clean Up Release Notes (What's New)**
    *   *Description:* Review and revise the "What's new" release notes for the next Play Store update to remove all technical jargon (e.g., mentions of ADB commands). Ensure all text is sleek, simple, and strictly user-facing.

### Track A: UI & Quick-Logging Enhancements
*   **[ ] A1: Routine Templates (Quick-Log)**
    *   *Description:* Allow users to define group templates (e.g., "Leg Day", "Push Day") and log them simultaneously with one tap instead of selecting individual exercises.
    *   *Implementation Tip:* Add a new `WorkoutTemplate` entity in Room and implement a custom multi-select selector on the log board.
*   **[ ] A2: Structured Sets/Reps Inputs**
    *   *Description:* Add a structured input for sets, reps, and weights (e.g., `3 sets x 10 reps @ 60kg`) inside the logging sheet, supplementing the existing free-form notes.
    *   *Implementation Tip:* Leverage simple regex or structured DB columns in `WorkoutEntry`.
*   **[ ] A3: Swipe-to-Delete Confirmation Step**
    *   *Description:* Require a confirmation step (e.g., a simple dialog or confirmation banner) before deleting a workout when a user swipes left, reducing accidental deletions.
    *   *Implementation Tip:* Wrap the SwipeDismiss-triggered action in a standard Material 3 AlertDialog.
*   **[ ] A4: Weekly View DatePicker Navigation**
    *   *Description:* Enable tapping the date header in the Weekly View to launch a DatePicker. Choosing a date sets the 7-day rolling window immediately, eliminating the need to tap arrow navigation buttons repeatedly to go far back in the past.
    *   *Implementation Tip:* Use Material 3 `rememberDatePickerState()` and update the Home/History viewmodel range offset logic dynamically.
*   **[ ] A5: Daily Workout Reminders (Notifications)**
    *   *Description:* Allow users to define a daily reminder time in settings and receive a local push notification reminding them to log their active exercises.
    *   *Implementation Tip:* Utilize Android's `WorkManager` with a `PeriodicWorkRequest` scheduling local notifications via `NotificationManager` at the designated daily time offset.

### Track B: Insights & Canvas Analytics
*   **[ ] B1: Canvas-Drawn Progression Charts**
    *   *Description:* Build lightweight progression graphs (e.g., weight over time or workout frequency charts) drawn entirely on Jetpack Compose `Canvas`.
    *   *Implementation Tip:* Do NOT pull in MPAndroidChart. Draw custom coordinate axes, grids, and paths programmatically.
*   **[ ] B2: Session Streaks & Targets**
    *   *Description:* Add a weekly target tracker (e.g., "Goal: 3 workouts/week") and calculate user streaks fully on-device.

### Track C: Data Freedom & Portability
*   **[ ] C1: CSV / JSON Backup Export & Import**
    *   *Description:* Since there are no cloud accounts, provide a button to manually export the database as a CSV or JSON file to the user's Local Storage, and allow restoring from it.
    *   *Implementation Tip:* Use Android Document Provider (`Intent.ACTION_CREATE_DOCUMENT`) for storage framework compliance.
*   **[ ] C2: Trash Bin & Retention Lifecycle**
    *   *Description:* Add a "Trash" collection state for deleted workouts. Workouts marked as deleted will go to the Trash folder and automatically purge after a user-configurable number of retention days. Users can restore any items from the Trash back to their active history.
    *   *Implementation Tip:* Add an `isDeleted` Boolean field and a `deletedAt` Long timestamp to `WorkoutEntry`, query them under a custom DAO view, and configure an automatic cleanup job or database trigger.

### Track D: System AI & AppFunctions Extensions
*   **[ ] D1: Expose Statistics to Google Assistant**
    *   *Description:* Add new `@AppFunction` entry points enabling assistant agents to query summary statistics.
    *   *Examples:* `getWorkoutCountForRange(startTime: Long, endTime: Long): Int` or `getMostFrequentWorkout(daysAgo: Int): String`.
*   **[ ] D2: Voice Shortcuts Integration**
    *   *Description:* Hook AppFunctions into Google Assistant routines so users can say: *"Hey Google, start my Chest Day template on FlinkLog"*.

## 🛠️ 2. Verification Protocol for Roadmap Tasks
Before mark-completing any task from this roadmap:
1.  **Create a Spec File:** Draft a specification file in `docs/features/` mapping the new functionality and automated verify steps.
2.  **Ensure Zero Bloat:** Check the release build APK size to guarantee the app remains under 3.5MB:
    ```bash
    ./gradlew assembleRelease
    ```
3.  **Run Quality Suite:**
    ```bash
    ./gradlew compileDebugKotlin lintDebug testDebugUnitTest
    ```
