## 📋 2. Functional Requirements

1. **Date Defaults:** All logs default to the current system date/time. The user can override
   logging time using picker options inside the logging sheet.
2. **Multi-Activity Entry:** Tapping Cardio or Gym exercise chips activates multi-selection.
   Tapping "Log Workout" opens a bottom sheet with a text entry card for each selected exercise.
3. **"Copy to All" Notes:** Tapping the copy icon next to any note text field instantly copies its
   content to all other text inputs inside the bottom sheet.
4. **Swipe to Delete:** Users can swipe any logged card to the left to delete it. A confirmation
   Snackbar appears with an "Undo" action.
5. **Swipe Tutorial:** On new installs, a guidance card shows how to swipe to delete. The card is
   permanently hidden once dismissed by the user.
6. **Post-Log Note Editing:** Tapping the note text of a logged card opens an edit dialog to change
   notes.
