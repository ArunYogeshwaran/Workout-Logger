# Feature Specification: Google Auto Backup

This document details the specifications and verification test cases for Android Auto Backup and
device recovery support.

## 🏗️ 1. Technical Reference

* **Configuration XMLs:**
    * [backup_rules.xml](../../app/src/main/res/xml/backup_rules.xml) (Defines file
      inclusion/exclusion)
    * [data_extraction_rules.xml](../../app/src/main/res/xml/data_extraction_rules.xml) (Defines
      Android 12+ cloud extraction filters)
* **Database Manifests:**
    * [AndroidManifest.xml](../../app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml) (Enables rules and configures
      permissions)

## 📋 2. Functional Requirements

1. **Scope of Backup:** The backup system must copy all local SQLite Room database streams,
   including:
    * Primary database file (`workout_database`)
    * Write-Ahead Log database helper file (`workout_database-wal`)
    * Shared memory index mapping file (`workout_database-shm`)
2. **Encryption:** Backups are sent to the private Google Drive account of the user's Android
   session. Backups are encrypted end-to-end and exempt from storage quotas.
3. **Frictionless Restore:** Upon reinstalling the app on the same device or switching to a new
   Android phone under the same Google account, all user data (history, logs, categories) must
   restore automatically before the first launch.

## 🧪 3. Verification Test Suite

### Test Case 4.1: Manual ADB backup & Restore (On-Device simulation)

1. Log at least 3 workouts on the Home screen and add a custom exercise category.
2. Connect your phone/emulator with USB debugging active.
3. Force immediate backup via terminal:
   ```bash
   adb shell bmgr backupnow com.ayogeshwaran.workoutlogger
   ```
4. *Verify:* Terminal returns: `Package com.ayogeshwaran.workoutlogger backup success`.
5. Uninstall the application:
   ```bash
   adb uninstall com.ayogeshwaran.workoutlogger
   ```
6. Reinstall the application from scratch.
7. Launch the app and open the Home and History tabs.
8. *Verify:* All previously logged workouts and your custom category are present.
9. Run a query on the Room DB to verify there is no corruption in WAL/SHM streams.

## 🤖 4. Verification Guidelines for AI

Ensure that database definitions do not bypass Auto Backup rules. The database helper files must be
saved under the default app storage directories:
`/data/data/com.ayogeshwaran.workoutlogger/databases/`
