## 🏗️ 1. Technical Reference

* **Key Composables:**
    * `AddCustomWorkoutDialog`
      in [HomeScreen.kt](../../app/src/main/java/com/ayogeshwaran/workoutlogger/presentation/home/HomeScreen.kt) (
      Add category dialog)
    * `FilterChip` layout inside category rows
      in [HomeScreen.kt](../../app/src/main/java/com/ayogeshwaran/workoutlogger/presentation/home/HomeScreen.kt)
* **Logical Components:**
    * `addCustomWorkoutType` and `deleteCustomWorkoutType`
      inside [HomeViewModel.kt](../../app/src/main/java/com/ayogeshwaran/workoutlogger/presentation/home/HomeViewModel.kt)
    * `CustomWorkoutTypeEntity`
      in [CustomWorkoutTypeEntity.kt](../../app/src/main/java/com/ayogeshwaran/workoutlogger/data/local/entity/CustomWorkoutTypeEntity.kt) (
      Database persistence)

## 📋 2. Functional Requirements

1. **Creation Chip:** Users can add a custom exercise category by tapping the `+` chip located at
   the end of the Gym or Cardio lists.
2. **Input Rules:**
    * Empty inputs are blocked, displaying: `"Name cannot be empty"`.
    * Duplicate exercise names within categories are blocked, displaying:
      `"This workout type already exists"`.
3. **Visual Lifecycle:** Custom categories display a clear/delete `x` icon overlay on the chip.
   Tapping the `x` opens a delete confirmation dialog.
4. **Data Isolation:** Deleting a custom exercise type deletes the category chip from the selection
   board, but **does not** delete or alter workouts already logged in history using that category.

## 🧪 3. Verification Test Suite

### Test Case 3.1: Add Custom Exercise

1. On the Home screen, find the Gym categories list.
2. Scroll to the end and tap the **`+`** chip.
3. Type `"Calisthenics"` and tap **Save**.
4. *Verify:* A custom chip named `"Calisthenics"` with a delete `"x"` icon appears in the selection
   list.
5. *Verify:* A Snackbar showing `"Custom workout added!"` appears.

### Test Case 3.2: Duplicate Validation

1. Open the add custom dialog again (Test Case 3.1).
2. Type `"Calisthenics"` (exact duplicate) and tap **Save**.
3. *Verify:* The dialog remains open and displays the error message:
   `"This workout type already exists"`.
4. Type `"   "` (blank space) and tap **Save**.
5. *Verify:* The dialog displays: `"Name cannot be empty"`.

### Test Case 3.3: Delete Custom Exercise Chip

1. Tap the **`x`** close button on the custom `"Calisthenics"` chip.
2. A deletion confirmation dialog appears. Tap **Delete**.
3. *Verify:* The `"Calisthenics"` chip disappears from the selection list.
4. *Verify:* A Snackbar showing `"Custom workout deleted"` is displayed.

## 🤖 4. Executing Automated Tests

AI agents can run unit tests verifying custom type validations and DB records:

```bash
./gradlew testDebugUnitTest --tests "com.ayogeshwaran.workoutlogger.presentation.home.HomeViewModelTest"
```
